Data structure :
    A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.

asymptotic analysis :
    Asymptotic analysis is a mathematical technique used for understanding the behavior of algorithms as their input increases:

Big O :
    Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the asymptotic behavior of a function as its input grows infinitely large. It provides a way to characterize the efficiency of algorithms and data structures. 

memory leaks :
    A memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in a heap and forget to delete it. The consequence of the memory leak is that it reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory.

linear and non-linear :

    In this structure, the elements are arranged sequentially or linearly and attached to one another. In this structure, the elements are arranged hierarchically or non-linear manner. Arrays, linked list, stack, queue are the types of a linear data structure. Trees and graphs are the types of a non-linear data structure.

linked list :
    A linked list is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in the list is called a node, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the list is called the tail.

What Are the Types of Linked Lists?
    Singly linked lists.
    Doubly linked lists.
    Circular linked lists.
    Circular doubly linked lists.


// # time complexity of linear search

    time complexity of linear search O(n)

// # Binnary search has time complexity 

    Binnary search time complexity O(log n)


// # single Linked list

    undo functionallity in application.
    File system management
    image viewer

// # double linked list application

    // * music playes has frend and backward button
    // * browser undo redu.

// # linked list vs array 

    Linked list takes O(1) for insertion and deletion while array O(n)

// # what is recursion

    function is called itself is recursion.

// # garbage collection

    Garbage collection (GC) is a dynamic approach to automatic memory management and heap allocation that processes and identifies dead memory blocks and reallocates storage for reuse. The primary purpose of garbage collection is to reduce memory leaks.

// # why we need datastructure

    Data structures are essential for two main reasons: they make the code more efficient, and they make the code easier to understand.

// ************Data structure -2******************

// # sorting algorithm

    In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an orde

    A stable sorting algorithm is a sorting algorithm that preserves the relative order of elements with equal keys.

// # bubble sort

    bubble sort is the easiast sort in algorithm.

// # Best case senarios of Bubble sort, Insertion sort

    if the array is already sorted means we can use these.

// # which sort is best for smaller value

    insertion sort

// # What is stack?

    A Stack is a linear data structure that holds a linear, ordered sequence of elements.
    it's follwed the principal is last in first out


// # when to use stack insted of array :

    when we required dynamic memory at time we can use.

// # What is queue?

    queue is a datastructure is sqeuenre or liner based datastructure
    which is followed a priciple is first in first out


// # Types of queue

    linear queue, circular queue, priority queue, de-queue


// # double edged queue

    d-queue is a double ended queue

// # priority queue

    A priority queue is a type of queue that arranges elements based on their priority values. Elements with higher priority values are typically retrieved before elements with lower priority values.

// # hashtable 

    a HASH table a datarunc


// # collision 

     A collision occurs when more than one value to be hashed by a particular hash function hash to the same slot in the table or data structure (hash table) being generated by the hash function

// # tree

A tree data structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges.


// # root node

The root node is the highest node in the tree structure, and has no parent

// # child node

    Child. The node, a descendant of any node, is known as child nodes in data structures. In a tree, any number of parent nodes can have any number of child nodes. In a tree, every node except the root node is a child node.

// # siblings node 

    Sibling nodes are nodes on the same hierarchical level under the same parent node. 

// # degree of node

    Total number of the children node is called degree of node.

// # internal node

    node has child node meanse  that is internal node

// # Types of tree

AVL tree
ballanced tree
Red black tree

perfect tree : 
        same deepth and same level Perfect tree.

balanced tree :
    A balanced binary tree or height-balanced binary tree is such a tree whose left and right subtrees' heights differ by not more than 1, 

// # weighted graph in data structure
    A weighted graph is a graph in which each edge is assigned a numerical value, called a weight, to represent a metric such as distance, cost, or time between the connected vertices.
