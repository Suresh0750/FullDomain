Data structure :
    A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose.

asymptotic analysis :
    Asymptotic analysis is a mathematical technique used for understanding the behavior of algorithms as their input increases:

Big O :
    Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the asymptotic behavior of a function as its input grows infinitely large. It provides a way to characterize the efficiency of algorithms and data structures. 

memory leaks :
    A memory leak occurs when programmers create a memory in a heap and forget to delete it. The consequence of the memory leak is that it reduces the performance of the computer by reducing the amount of available memory.

linear and non-linear :

    In this structure, the elements are arranged sequentially or linearly and attached to one another. In this structure, the elements are arranged hierarchically or non-linear manner. Arrays, linked list, stack, queue are the types of a linear data structure. Trees and graphs are the types of a non-linear data structure.

linked list :
    A linked list is a data structure that stores a sequence of elements. Each element in the list is called a node, and each node has a reference to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the list is called the tail.

What Are the Types of Linked Lists?
    Singly linked lists.
    Doubly linked lists.
    Circular linked lists.
    Circular doubly linked lists.
